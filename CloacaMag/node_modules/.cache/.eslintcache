The mini watermelon, which I\n    brought home from the farmer’s market yesterday, has sprouted a patch of\n    short, coarse hairs. They are dark and close to the surface, like the high\n    and tight my cousin came home with after basic training. The gala apples\n    and navel oranges seem repelled from this pubescent melon; nothing else\n    touches its surface, as though it’s covered in an invisible film. My hunger\n    flees like an escaped convict, but my curiosity is piqued. With an index\n    finger, I lightly buzz the rind; it’s deceptively soft, more like a newborn\n    baby down than the stubble I expected. There is a sizeable portion left\n    bare and striped green; I lightly stroke it, expecting the give of face\n    flesh, but it’s still cool, inscrutable. My eyes play tricks where\n    sometimes, the melon seems to breathe, just slightly, sighing at its rim. I\n    think suddenly of eggs, and scoop it into my hands. A few hairs carch at\n    the dry calluses on my palms. It feels like rubbing velvet in the wrong\n    direction, and I gag.\n  <br />\n  <br />\n    I bring the melon into the bathroom and set it in the sink so I can\n    undress. I start the bath, testing with a toe to make sure it’s warm, not\n    my typical steam heat. I cradle the melon to my stomach; it accidentally\n    rubs against a nipple and repulsion ripples through me. Still, I sink us\n    both into the bath. An instinctive tugging tells me to keep it at a\n    comfortable temperature. I let it float at the water’s surface for a minute\n    as I try to tug a cogent thought from my addled mind, but nothing fits\n    fruit suddenly takes on human qualities. I establish that I can’t (won’t)\n    eat it, but beyond that, logic flings itself into a precipice. So I reach\n    for the shampoo bottle. I suds my strands and submerge, toeing the\n    watermelon to the other end of the tub for minimal contact. The water\n    covering my face calms me. I come up for air and grab the melon, gently\n    start rubbing shampoo into its bristles with my fingers. Hmmmmmm. A low,\n    quiet sigh emerges from the rind, though I can see no hole or fissure.\n    Water splashes out of the tub in gurgling waves as I push the melon away\n    from me. The sound stops, but doesn’t; the alien note is retained in my\n    brain, replaying. I shiver, half from my torso being exposed to the air,\n    half from the uncanny sound. The melon has listed on its side so that the\n    hair points towards me like mold eating its rotten findings. I steel\n    myself, palm the fruit, and push it to the bottom of the tub. Through the\n    milky shampoo residue, a small bubble grows and pops. Then another. Soon a\n    steady onslaught, the bubbles growing in size, popping violently, even as\n    the melon beneath my grip does not move. At the edge of my memory, a\n    snapshot: my step-brother with the heel of his hand on my cheekbone,\n    holding my face against the carpet. I can smell cat piss in the fibers. A\n    small hair a few inches away dances with my ragged exhalations. One arm is\n    pinned beneath my chest and starting to fall asleep. The seconds stretch\n    long as taffy before he leaves.\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    And then I vomit into the bath, snap back. My mouth expels a steady stream\n    of black seeds. They taste bitter and bruise my throat as they’re expelled.\n    They float on the surface like the ants I used to drown in bowls of soapy\n    water to appease my mother, forever trying to scrub them out of the corners\n    of our kitchen. My stomach clenches and unclenches, forcing everything from\n    me until I’m left with a small strand hanging from my lip, the consistency\n    of egg whites. I don’t bother to wipe my mouth, simply stand up and let the\n    whole mess of seeds and spittle and suds and water drip from my breasts and\n    stomach and limbs. Nothing rises to the surface of what’s left, and I don’t\n    bother to unplug the tub, just step out and let myself leak onto the bath\n    mat, a puddle of expulsion forming around my naked feet. And all I can\n    think of is the two clean marks I will leave behind, two unspoiled spots\n    amidst the aftermath.\n              </pre>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <img src='https://web.archive.org/web/20090902002637/http://www.geocities.com/redondoguy2001/Halloween/pumpkins_lighted.gif' style={{width:'10vw',height:'10vw',marginLeft:'40vw'}}/>\n              </p>\n        </div>\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nexport {Quinnrfairchild,Quinnrfairchildbio}","/Users/willlllllllllllll/Documents/GitHub/CloacaMag.github.io/CloacaMag/src/component/Authors/philipsorensen.js",["135","136","137"],[],"import React from 'react';\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction Philipsorensonbio(){\n    return <div  >\n     \n      <p> R Daniel Brown is the poet laureate of every crop circle in Ohio.\n         Recent or upcoming work can be found in Boston Review, Apogee, VIDA Review, Cosmonauts Avenue, and others.\n        They're the author of the microchapbook, Dear John, Love Letters to John Connor… (Ghost City Press, 2018).\n         You can usually find them on twitter, @notalake.\n</p>\n      </div>\n        \n       \n}\nfunction Philipsorenson(){\n    return <div >\n            <p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n              <pre style={{display:'flex',flexDirection:\"column\",alignItems:'center'}}> \n              <pre>\n                “Desire is absolute if the desiring being is<br /> mortal and the Desired\n                    invisible.” Absolute,<br /> and boundless because “it nourishes itself . . <br />. with\n                    its hunger.” Each touch is always<br /> interrupted before the encounter.
