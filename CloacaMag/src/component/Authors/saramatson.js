              <pre>
                <br />
                cracked champagne crawl across<br />
the garden (gorgeous) to a chapteric end<br />
she was understood like a crowded house<br />
stinking + warm	loud + heavy<br />
haunted cellarbound <br />
<br />
swallowing every wildflower at ankle height<br />
her roadside demeanor carried a lascivious promise<br />
of enrobed kings or favored secrets<br />
fluffy lichen growing in patches<br />
&nbsp;     just below her redeemed chin<br />
mysteries // indeterminate eyes she<br />
makes thunderbolts from age + experience<br />
effortless skywonder glittering from <br />
pressureheat + youth<br />
<br />
her liquid cage<br />
appears as irony or a devil in a onesie (ugly drunk)<br />
bony experts entice nerves w/ status updates +<br />
the fennel stuffed beneath skin<br />
<br />
sweet future hissing from a crack in the sofa<br />
the base of her neck sings w/ strange tones<br />
insisting on lip or whittled contact<br />
bright suckling reveals vermillion treasure<br />
buried by time + the great inexhaustible sea<br />
<br />
damp against fingerpads but heavy at the cuff<br />
she rises among seawillows to sway<br />
lefthanded stars brightening the skyway<br />

              <strong>&lt;new dress&gt;</strong>
              <pre>
                <br />
                heavy cloak fringed to my outlandish cuff<br />
my face like a denim leg<br />
cradle my enthusiasm like a precious<br />
baby locked in disorder<br />
&nbsp;		                       booted<br />
i learn lefthanded piano the way<br />
the old gods intended<br />
&nbsp;		                       beautiful<br />
&nbsp;		                       eyeless<br />
&nbsp;		                       nervously<br />
&nbsp;		                       alone<br />
i wear leylines as shoelaces<br />
each powerful contact the type of madness<br />
only fingernails made of sugar would agree upon<br />
short		               unchlorinated<br />
i imagine twilight as screaming<br />
natural urgency over candlelight like<br />
perfect areola glinting past retinas<br />
my beard burns the sides of my cheeks<br />
a completed collection of jewelry<br />
&nbsp;		                       (for lovers)<br />
awaits pricetags + other human borings<br />
<br />
place the jewels in my shorthairs +<br />
galaxy it forward<br />
shadows smoking in relief hours after<br />
the illuminated arm of my sleeve<br />
billowed high + away<br />
