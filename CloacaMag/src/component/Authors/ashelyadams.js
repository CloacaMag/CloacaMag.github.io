              <strong>I went back in time to beat the shit out of my Paleolithic ancestor</strong>
              &nbsp;because it’s easier to get plutonium or whatever for a time machine than it
    is to get my rotten wisdom teeth yanked from my gums so instead I’m ripping
    through spacetime and wailing on my great-great something-something grandpa
    because I learned Lamarck was right and the giraffes are getting taller
    from stretching their necks and we’re all fat because the only way peasants
    survived feudalism was by turning every scrap into golden weight on the
    bones and here I am inflicting my own generational trauma fists to cheeks
    until those molars are skidding on limestone blood on ochre building the
    arch of that cave art auroch with the spray of spittle and yeah I know you
    need those teeth to grind seeds but I’m from the future babe all we know is
    the crank of the cogs and your adaptation is holding me back sorry you poor
    bastard we never beat the predators just built a new one that has too many
    fangs to shatter.
