   <strong>when my boy died i couldn’t let go of anything</strong>
<pre>
<br />

the first time i saw a dead boy i hardly noticed <br /> 
he was a shadow of a shadow      half visible and doe soft<br />
<br />
eventually i saw them everywhere<br />   
dying boys all across the lawns and highways<br /> 
<br />
the churches and schools    jostling about<br />   
bumping each other gently   and murmuring <br />    
<br />
always murmuring<br />
my   there   can you   wait   wait<br />
<br />
sometimes i tried to listen and sometimes i didn’t<br />   
let the words  float past me  into the telephone wires<br />
<br />
and contrails   past the geese flying south<br />    
away     away<br />

at first, i could let them go     they didn’t hold me<br />
 and i didn’t hold them<br />
 <br />
 just let them drift<br /> 
 <br />
 &nbsp;                     then my boy died

 </pre>
 <br />
 <br />
 <br /> 
  <strong>i want to tell you about the mountain</strong>

    <pre>
      <br />
&nbsp;      in the dark i see them before they leave<br />
&nbsp;                every boy in my town<br />
<br />
born with river whispering<br />
&nbsp;                soft and sweet<br />
<br />
<br />
their faces           eyes set in and dark<br />
<br />
<br />
we used to watch them by the river<br />
&nbsp;        every son called forward one by one<br />
pulled by the thing in them<br />
&nbsp;                that knowing<br />
<br />
some deep river call<br />
some inescapable need to prove<br />
<br />
the boys in our town fade into men<br />
<br />
<br />
we watch them at the river<br />
<br />
we see them disappear<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
