              <strong>why you’re not getting laid</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
    just throw the scraps of your own skin on the floor like a normal dirty<br />
    person. lay your scabs on the corners of windowsills. it is in this way you<br />
    are amused by the human body. why else would you, a normal person, do<br />
    anything such as that. you are a dirty, dirty person. you are a glutton of<br />
    compliments, a slut for excuses. how you are a dirty normal person. how<br />
    much spittle does your mouth dribble onto your pillow each night? where<br />
    were your feet. where is your decency. and what is decent, normal person?<br />
    what might normally be considered decent? to any reasonable person, what<br />
    could be said—what is right? what is decent?<br />
    <br />
    what is right. what is decent. how you are a what, dirty person. how you<br />
    are a rat. how with your hands so pale so fragile. there are these little<br />
    bubbles. that come to the surface under your skin when you have been<br />
    washing. and washing. and washing. no ritual can rid you. there is a<br />
    certain suffering to be endured. and how you are so little, normal human.<br />
    you are contact irritant. you have and are dyshidrosis. will you pop and<br />
    fester, you dirty dirty girl? yes, there is nothing to be salvaged in these<br />
    words, no, there is nothing, there is nothing at all. how there is, there<br />
    is, there is and will be nothing to be salvaged.<br />
