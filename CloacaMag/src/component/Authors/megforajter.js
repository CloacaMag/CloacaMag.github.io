    <strong>love poem at night time</strong>
<pre>
<br />
bodiless, removed from the sack<br />
the skeleton of my husband<br />
on a metal table<br />
a collection of things instead <br />
of the chemical grace that dozed<br />
in my bed.<br />
<br />
<br />
how can i say birthday cake? horror.<br />
i wailed at the unsight of him, pulled<br />
at my hair<br />
uncanny— not so much the death but the inversion<br />
slimy with life still–<br />
like flesh but<br />
outside.<br />
i could read his face in the skull and it devolved me.<br />

<strong>haunted house poem</strong>
  <br />
  <br />
  <i>
  black sludge of the<br />
night creeping grass<br />
essentials which knock<br />
me out of my boots<br />
i say baby doll what else<br />
needs to happen do<br />
i need to electrocute<br />
small animals the wind<br />
the bones inside of my<br />
shoes<br />
the house on the hill<br />
groans even when the<br />
air is still<br />
and i have no other<br />
barrier no skin to cover<br />
my intimates no flaps<br />
for my ears the thin<br />
skin of my eyelids<br />
useless against it the<br />
match strike<br />
like  halogen but <br />
no glow no lamps<br />
the radiators<br />
the windows creak the<br />
drapes shuffle against<br />
the glass without my<br />
hand to guide them<br />
i feel no air have no<br />
absolute  despite<br />
continuous <br />
cars barreling down<br />
the road will lullabye <br />
the bog takes with it<br />
each ear that settles its<br />
bone upon the air  i do<br />
not know enough<br />
about the devastated<br />
teenagers congesting<br />
my halls creatures <br />
rubbing their sneakers<br />
over the dour grain of <br />
my floorboard i see<br />
their fingerprints on<br />
my tea cups weep<br />
dream of needle<br />
pierced ears for long<br />
months afterwards<br />
when i wake the drapes<br />
around the bed have<br />
shredded themselves<br />
into ghouls clambour<br />
loudly down the<br />
hallways and i am<br />
in danger i cannot<br />
breathe without the<br />
complete barrier<br />
between my lungs and<br />
the sludge of night<br />
or air between my<br />
burden and the bog<br />
screeching with rot<br />
outside the kitchen<br />
door.<br />

<strong>joy interior</strong>
<pre>
  <br />
  my joy interior freckles <br />
my joy blows out its own brains on the front lawn so all the neighbors can see <br />
my joy interior secretly loves nylons & romance <br />
is romance <br />
my joy crowns on the hour, goes back into the closet like a cuckoo clock <br />
everyone shits in the closet like a cuckoo <br />
my husband fucks in the closet like a cuckoo <br />
i’ll fucking vape if i want to, i’m an adult <br />
darling, i’m sticking my finger in your eye because it gives me joy <br />
you with the pupils made of blue glass <br />
you’ve filled my body with blood and glass. <br />
i’m dying on the front lawn <br />
i’m crushed into asymptomatic bits. its <br />
relaxing. <br />
