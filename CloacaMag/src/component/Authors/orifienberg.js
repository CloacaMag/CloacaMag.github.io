              <strong> <i>Our Hunger</i></strong>
              <pre >
                <br />
                We obsess about making babies. It is all we can think about, this self-propagation. To take the <br />best parts of each other, the proudest, smallest, waving telomeres, and combine them to fulfill <br />our biological imperative. We paint every room in pastel colors, in blushes, and then create new<br /> rooms, just so we can paint them too. We are so hungry and so ready, so then we eat our babies. <br />
                <br />

We can’t help it. No one can help it. They are delicious. We make baby stir-fry with baby corn, <br />baby carrots, baby bok choi, baby spinach, baby eggplant.  From cocktail swords our teeth <br />envelope tender-sweet baby beets. We puree baby squash for soups and make baby breads from <br />baby zucchini. We feast on lamb and veal. There’s enough to share, and so we share every day.<br />
<br /> 

We roast and stuff a suckling pig, and as our drooling friends and family watch we carve off<br />cheery, fatty pieces. Luscious pieces for parents, and daintier, crispier pieces for friends. The<br />meat mugs for the camera: everyone loves it and encourages us to make more babies. We eat and<br />cry and eat some more, because we were so desperate to make a baby, and our baby is delicious.

              <strong><i>Where the Bees Are Going </i></strong>
              <pre>
              <br />
              Their yards were full with clover, their gardens with wild flowers. Everyone in the town hummed<br />happily, from sunup to sundown.  It was true, what they said about the townspeople: they sang<br />with sweet, strong voices, but when they spoke, they wheezed. It was a slurred and syrupy<br />sound.<br />
              <br />

One rainy day, everyone in town felt a need to sing.  They turned their heads towards the sky,<br />and when they opened their mouths, bees poured forth and became furry, yellow-black, shifting<br />ropes of notes, respected by lightning, rising beyond the clouds.  Some townsfolk climbed their<br />ropes, never to be seen again.<br />
<br />  

The air was thick with pollen when the coroners arrived.  They found silent bodies filled not with<br />blood, but with honey.  Ah ha! said one of the coroners, as though he had just solved an ancient<br />riddle.  They sneezed as they cut samples of honeycomb from chests and put them into little jars.
