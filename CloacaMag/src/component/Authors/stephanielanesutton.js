        <strong>Hermosa </strong>
        <pre style={{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap"}}>
        <br />
        Once, because I was in bad love, I rode to the end of Lake Michigan & back, or 60 miles.<br />
        <br />
        Returning to my apartment in Hermosa, I ran a cold shower & drank 80oz of King Cobra.<br />
        <br /> 
That was the night of the party where the host was robbed at gun point an hour after I left,<br />
my blood gold & bubbly as champagne.<br />
<br /> 
That was the night I met my new abuser. Punching my number into his phone, I spelled<br />
my name <i>A-f-t-e-r-g-l-o-w.</i> <br />
<br />
Last summer, I traded my throat chakra choker for red coral from a witch to keep<br />
incubuses away.
<br /> 
<br />
I kept it under my pillow, but once every 10 days I texted <i>Please fuck me</i> to a pentagram & took 25mg of melatonin to fall asleep.<br />
<br /> 
A handsome man appeared in my dreams. His white silk like man milk.<br />
His body like a widow’s.<br />
<br /> 
At the end of my closing shift at the bookstore one night, my manager’s husband cornered<br />
me with a question about his wife.<br />
<br /> <i>
Why can’t she seem to get along with anyone?
</i><br />
<br />
He kept solo cups of sour wine in his file cabinets.<br />
<br /> 
I felt like I couldn’t go home ever again, so I rode my brown Bayside until I reached the<br />
six-cornered star at the intersection of Cicero & Irving Park.<br />
<br /> 
The 3-storey buildings melted into 1-storey houses, pale aluminum siding in yellow or<br />blue. The sun dipped itself into the purple cream of low clouds; <i>The Joy of Losing Weight</i><br />tinned in my earbuds.<br />
<br /> 
That road is named Milwaukee because it goes northwest into Wisconsin and I thought of<br />going all the way.<br />
<br /> 
I kept going after that but I stopped reading street names.
