            a pirouette is nice<br />

but a pirouette requires a foot<br />

me<br />

if i had a foot<br />

that’s not what i’d do<br />

no<br />

i’d love the dirt<br />

i’d sink right in<br />

i’d grow new toes<br />

i’d rot them off<br />

i’d kick my way out through the fuckfestered wall<br />

i’d run away<br />

i’d run and run<br />
