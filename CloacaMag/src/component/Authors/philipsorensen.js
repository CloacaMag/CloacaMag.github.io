                “Desire is absolute if the desiring being is<br /> mortal and the Desired
                    invisible.” Absolute,<br /> and boundless because “it nourishes itself . . <br />. with
                    its hunger.” Each touch is always<br /> interrupted before the encounter. I am on
                    my<br /> knees in the dirt or in bed or on humid wood<br /> floors. You are above me. I
                    am under you.<br /> Pendulous belly, wide leafed plume poppy,<br /> dreamy cardinal,
                    engines at work, at their<br /> edges they harbor <i>buh buh buh</i> uselessness.

              for me particularly<br /> 
to be prone and filled up with vegetation<br />
<br />
to have the same diseases that plants have <br />
<br />
to be wearing a tasseled mask that is aroused by the sun <br />

“all springtimes past”<br />

buried in this face making this kind of piss<br />

erupting again <br />
<br />
two worms fighting in the dusk<br />
<br />
chimes <br />
<br />
are like a gland <br />
that opens the lily<br />
<br />
inside of the groaning statuary<br />
<br />
heavy porous sleep<br />
one circle of blue worms<br />
<br />
I am easy to cut like a resin<br />
<br />
I drink the plant’s piss<br />
